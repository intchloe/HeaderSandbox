# HeaderSandbox
Play with HTTP-headers! Can be very useful when learning about new security headers, finding bypasses, see how different browsers behave and much more! 

Demo: [http://headersandbox.com/](http://headersandbox.com/)

##TODO
- [ ] Add option to POST to HTTPS (from HTTP or HTTPS) - useful when playing with HTTP -> HTTPS requests
- [ ] Add an onion service - very useful to test connections between clear net -> onion land
- [ ] Add more static resources - SVG, webm, MP3, MP4 ... etc. 
- [ ] Add more examples in `/examples/` - also add good resources, W3C, RFC, github, blog posts ... etc
